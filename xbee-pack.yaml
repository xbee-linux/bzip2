schema-version: 1.0

description: |
  The Bzip2 package contains programs for compressing and decompressing files. Compressing text files with bzip2 yields a much better compression percentage than with the traditional gzip.
  Installed programs: bunzip2 (link to bzip2), bzcat (link to bzip2), bzcmp (link to bzdiff), bzdiff, bzegrep (link to bzgrep), bzfgrep (link to bzgrep), bzgrep, bzip2, bzip2recover, bzless (link to bzmore), and bzmore
  Installed libraries: libbz2.so
  Installed directory: /usr/share/doc/bzip2-1.0.8
  Short Descriptions
    bunzip2: Decompresses bzipped files
    bzcat: Decompresses to standard output
    bzcmp: Runs cmp on bzipped files
    bzdiff: Runs diff on bzipped files
    bzegrep: Runs egrep on bzipped files
    bzfgrep: Runs fgrep on bzipped files
    bzgrep: Runs grep on bzipped files
    bzip2: Compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression algorithm with Huffman coding; the compression rate is better than that achieved by more conventional compressors using “Lempel-Ziv” algorithms, like gzip
    bzip2recover: Tries to recover data from damaged bzipped files
    bzless: Runs less on bzipped files
    bzmore: Runs more on bzipped files

    libbz2: The library implementing lossless, block-sorting data compression, using the Burrows-Wheeler algorithm
